		/// represented by 2.25; midnight, 29 December 1899 is represented by -1.0; and 6 A.M., 29 December 1899 is 
		/// represented by -1.25. The base OLE Automation Date is midnight, 30 December 1899. The minimum OLE Automation 
		/// date is midnight, 1 January 0100. The maximum OLE Automation Date is the same as DateTime.MaxValue, the last
		/// moment of 31 December 9999. The ToOADate method throws an OverflowException if the current instance represents
